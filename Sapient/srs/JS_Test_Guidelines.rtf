\
Functionality Desired\
1.) The table displaying NAME and AGE is sortable data, clicking on the header sorts the data in ascending and descending order.\
2.) Each navigation link has a corresponding carousel, that have to be individual HTML's which get called thru ajax on click of the navigation links. [the carousel on screen is for the 1st link - Distinguished Tech Program, the other 3 carousels will be html's called thru ajax on using the navigation links on the left.]\
3.) Within Carousel: the enroll now button would set the focus to the Full Name text box: and the label ENROLL NOW would change to ENROLL NOW: [DUMMY DATA].\
4.) Form Validation: \
	a.) All fields are mandatory\
	b.) Validate email format\
	c.) Validate Mobile Number field (only numerics allowed)}
